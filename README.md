Quit brainrot. Unfollow trolls. Read essays. Go down rabbit holes.
Have a calendar. Maintain a todo list. Read old books. Watch old movies.
Turn on DND. Walk with intent. Eat without YouTube. Chew more.
Train without music. Plan for 15 minutes. Execute. Organise your desk.
Take something seriously. Read ancient scripts. Act fast. Find bread.
Eat clean. Journal. Save a life. Learn to code. Read poetry. Create art.
Stay composed. Refine your speech. Optimise for efficiency. Act sincere.
Help people. Be kind. Stop doing things that waste your time.
Follow your intuition. Craft reputation. Learn persuasion.
Systemise your day (or don’t). Write. Write more. Iterate violently.
Leave your phone at home. Walk to the grocery store. Talk to strangers.
Feed the dogs. Visit bookstores. Look for 1800s novels.
Experience art. Then love. Sit with a monk and offer them lunch.
Don’t talk shit about people. Embody virtue. Sit alone.
Do something with your life. What do you want to create?
Turn off your mind. Play. Play a sport. Combat sports.
Notice fonts in trees. Fall in love. Notice patterns on a table. Visualise it.
Talk to people with respect. Don’t hate. Be loving. Be real. Become yourself.
Cherrypick your qualities. Discard the useless. Rejections aren’t permanent.
Invite what aligns. Accept what does not. Read great people.
Be different. Choose different. Do great work. Let it consume you.
Lose your mind. Value your time. Experience life.
